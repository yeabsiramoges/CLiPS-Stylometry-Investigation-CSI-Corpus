Anna Bijns died in 1575.Pleij wrote about the caring real couple that they had taken advantage of the old woman and had only given her a poor funeral, 'the picture was made in 2013 by Judith Kessler in her dissertation Princesse der rhetoricers.Pleij and his source have not informed themselves sufficiently, 'because the price lists of the Church of Our Lady show that the funeral ceremony of the Dicheres was certainly respectable (pp.14-15) .About Anna\u00e2\\x80\\x99s eventual relationships with men is never known', 'although according to Pleij it seems 'as if she has emphatically and for a long time kept the path to her own marriage open', 'because she has never nun or beguine (1987', ' p.127).']['\u00e2\\x80\\x9cAnna actually does everything herself', 'regardless of the existing associations',' says Pleij (1987', ' p. 113).As Anna is no longer interested in a religious community, she also has access to a religious community.This is a missiable world', 'because the literary associations were then in their heyday in the Southern Netherlands and were also open to women (van Bruane', '2005', 'pp.24-25)', 'that's not the case.He was a forced decision', 'because for women from the middle class, being a member of a chamber of rhetoric was often comparable to being a member of a religious community: in both likes the official did no more than silently figure in tableaux vivants (van Bruane' , '2005', 'pp.22 and 24-25).The Antwerp poet had ambitious goals in the camera's hair.Another talk about hair insulation can be the mannelijke rederijkers in this work critical goods for the trade and change of the furniture.Some even went so far as to portray characters who questioned Roman beliefs.(Pleij', '2007', 'p. 637).It is almost inconceivable that Anna, 'who in her oeuvre committed the mother church with hard and goal', 'would become involved with such skeptics.']['2.2.\\tHer oeuvre'] ['What has been preserved in works by Anna\u00e2\\x80\\x99s hand', 'consists almost exclusively of choruses', 'the pinnacle of lyric art according to rhetoricians.A reference is a poem that contains a minimum of four lines, with a vast slot rule in one of the five lines.The rule of thumb before conclusiveness of the poem and works on the door of herhaling as a hamer on a picture in 80\\x93 of the boodschap wordt he stevig ingedramd.The genre was written for Anna in the Being, 'because to get the opportunity to be fierce not only in the content', 'but also through the form (Pleij', ' 2007', ' p. 340 and 372 ).She used the stick lines as repetitive, 'literary 'uppercuts' in the face of Luther and moral breakers.Choruses serve to warn and provoke, with their compelling structure, also a certain way of expressing music', which Pleij calls singing and which, according to him, can be compared to modern 'rapping' (Pleij', ' 2007', ' p. 343).According to Dirk Coigneau, 'emeritus professor of Germanic philology at the University of Ghent', 'the rhetoricians themselves called it 'pronuncieren'.The song became very popular with the speakers who used the songs to be played in different tunes.Ultimately, the structure with the obligatory final line is also adopted in the song, where there was no such obligation before (Coigneau, 1992, pp.256-257). ']['But despite the popularity of the chorus, rhetoricians were not eager to put it on the printing press.That wasn't a good idea for a new medium, but I also had a fear of plagiarism.\u00e2\\x80\\x9cIn the irrevocable immortalization of their texts [\u00e2\\x80\u00a6], [rhetoric chambers] also exercised their exclusive rights to them', '\u00e2\\x80\\x9d lays Pleij uit (1987', ' p. 360).The printers are now ready to jump to the printers to print the text in the most important way in the regional area.With rhyming texts that was certainly no easy task.Al the complications are many ways to the printing of Anna\u00e2\\x80\\x99s refreinbundels.The first thing that happened was that it was never tied to a camera, and the hair was printed and printed.Secondly, she wrote in Brabant', which was already a leading dialect in the sixteenth century (Pleij', ' 2007', ' p. 360).Finally, what distinguished her from the rhetoricians was that her work was printed during her lifetime and with her name on the title page.In rhetoric circles this is referred to as hunting and hunting (Meeus & Willaert', ' 2013', ' n.p.). ']['Anna never bundled or distributed her work herself', 'that was the work of the Antwerp Friars Minor.They were especially known for their fervent fight against the Reformation and saw that the theme of Anna's poems (the failure of marriage, 'Lutheran heresy') was in line with their own heritage (Pleij', '2007 ', ' p.377).Her people's language also suited their intentions, namely to make the message of the mother church accessible to the people (Pleij, 1987, p. 125).The brothers printed three reference bundles of Anna in respectievelijk 1528', 'rond 1548 and in 1567.The bundles were always very successful, 'with various herd prints during her lifetime (Pleij', ' 2007', ' p. 370) and even a Latin translation of her debut by the humanist Eligius Houchrius (van Bruane', ' 2005' , ' p. 7).Thanks to the translation, she even achieved European fame.Because Grandson brought the Friars Minor lyric from Anna to Omloop, 'he was very lost.They always selected grandkids they wanted to keep.Moreover, the order's monastery burned down during the Iconoclasm in 1566, which probably also caused much of Anna's work to disappear.There were also references also very popular for 'loser print', 'that never meant anything to be kept anyway.Ultimately, 222 of Anna's choruses and 1 song survived, but there must have been much more (Pleij', ' 2000', ' pp.199-201).']['A pitfall when reading Anna Bijns' work is a too one-sided reading.It can be completely considered as a literate lesser broeder ordering, but also as a running battle over hair itself.Both of them are real lawyers.He has similarities between her work and her life', 'because the marriages of her brother and sister have 'at least brought her into problems' (Pleij', ' 1987', ' p. 127 ) ', 'but her oeuvre is certainly not autobiographical.Ten first spreekt hair work zichzelf tegen; in the other words, these men are used and in the others, they are brought into love (Trieste, ' 1990', ' p. 413).Secondly, her theme of marital ridicule is almost compulsory training material in rhetoricians' chambers,' believes Pleij (1987', ' p. 123).The strongest argument against the autobiography reading also comes from Pleij: \"It is not appropriate to identify the first person in literary works, including those from the past, with their author\" (1987). ', ' p.122).']['3.\\t \u00e2\\x80\\x98Merten van Rossom still seems to be the Best of tween\u00e2\\x80\\x99'] It's a good thing to have in front of you.The book is one of the most important topics in the 80's and 99's oeuvre, and is named after the reform.This has a good character, a folk style, and a perfect beheersing of the genre rules.In the chorus there are eight eight-tiered streams,' says Anna Bijns Maarten Luther and Maarten Van Rossem with each other.How the hair is the most popular work is', 'is the niet terug te vinden in one of the three printed reference bundles.It is overwritten via a handwriting of the hand of minor brothers Engelbert van der Donck', 'the handwriting of A. The handwriting is moeilijk te dateren omdat he was made in different years', 'the first writing was made in 1545 (Pleij ', '2000', 'p.189).']['3.1.\\tInside analysis']Van Rossem was a Gelderland army commander who looted and set fire to Brabant in July and August 1542.On that raid he attacked Antwerp, 'just in its Golden Age', 'but the city was able to repel him.His passage through the duchy sowed so much fear and panic that the first goods media hype landed in the situation and became safe.In his lifetime he gave away all sorts of new things', 'the most neutral people of the modern world', 'the Van Rossem depicted as the incarnate devil: he doesn't need the military codes of honor and coopts henchmen' , 'and he sneaks into Brabant at night', 'so to speak on a crusade against the Turks.Everything will be seen as structural maneuvers', 'although Van Rossem was in fact a cunning general', 'he owed his successes to satisfied troops and innovative strategies', 'such as making his soldiers crawl on the ground to racialize the enemy .Hij will be able to cope with the city of Friesland and will be visible to the verifijnde architect.One of the best possible conditions is the majority of the prescription for depression in the future (Pleij', '2000', 'p. 244).Pleij even suggested in 2007 that these depressions are at least encouraged by the character assassination via the news storm (p. 579). ']['Es Rossom murderous', 'Luther has done that'] ['Two hundred thousand farmers through his business;'] ['Many es have been beheaded', 'burned', 'failed meig yards'] ['For his false teaching', 'both men and women;']['Merten van Rossom may hinder;']['This and will not diminish his sin', ''] ['I and will not excuse or make reen;'] ['Although both are two vicious spears', ' '] ['Still Merten shines van Rossom the Best of Tween.(Bijns', '1975', 'pp.43-44)\"]According to her, it is almost desirable to be killed by Van Rossem, 'because he makes you a child of God.M.a.w.: Victims of the mercenary receive a direct ticket to heaven thanks to their martyrdom.This is in stark contrast to the followers of Luther: they kill their souls with their error and will have grandson 'eternal weeping' in hell (Bijns', ' 1975', ' p. 45).Furthermore, Anna insults Luther as 'prince of all false prophets' and calls him 'filled with the Holy Spirit' (1975', 'pp.44-45).The latter', 'pleij uit uit', 'is a

never as funny as Luther', 'wanted the last heeft as a result of her hair, which 200,000 people did die in the German Boerenoorlog.Anna does not go further than Scheldden with catechism truths and rumors, 'because for genuine theological arguments she lacks the necessary intellectual baggage.On the other hand, she knows the catechism', ' because she taught it in her class (Pleij', ' 2007', '

again rutere.(Bijns', ' 1975', ' p. 44)'] ['Anna says here that it is not a good idea for Van Rossem to travel fearlessly through Brabant', 'because he is a warlord and a true 'crutere' \\x9d (1975',

monasteries largely untouched (Bijns', ' 1975', ' p. 43).How it might never happened is, 'it is an open defense of the captain.Finally, Pleij notes that Anna Van Rossem always calls 'the best' (1975', 'pp.41-45) and not 'the at least bad' (2000', ' p.219).']['3.2.\\t Tradition and purpose'] ['There is no doubt about the purpose of this work: it was written to make Luther's actions even more frightening and Anna does this by comparing Luther to the man who unleashed mass hysteria in Brabant .At first glance, the chorus also seems to be part of the news hype surrounding the looter.The pamphlets, songs and loose printed matter stirred up panic through rhetorical tricks and thus mainly gave a distorted image of reality and Van Rossem.A great example of this is the Van Rossem, after his plundering raid in Brabant, joined Emperor Charles V', 'who ruled the Netherlands at that time', 'and that was sensational while the news reports shortly before indicated that these men liked each other raw (Pleij', '2007', 'p. 579).On closer inspection, Anna places Luther real in a new one, 'more frightening dimension' by comparing him with the monstrous Van Rossem.Differently stated: if Van Rossem is monstrous, then Luther is devilish.The actuality of the problem is a problem for the review.A typical characteristic of Anna Bijns\u00e2\\x80\\x99 work that here too is dead uiting come',

']['4.\\t Conclusion'] ['In conclusion he can be told that it is at least strange that Anna was already highly valued in her own time.She writes with a smooth pen in true rhetorician style, although she never joined a chamber.This was one of the most ambitious and one of the most important fans of the Rooms church.She owes her successes and fame in our time not only to herself, but also to the Antwerp Friars Minor.They saw her as an ally in their struggle against the Reformation and moral decline and had her work printed and distributed. ']['In the two parts of the paper, the characteristics of the work are described: the words of Maarten Luther and the world of Maarten Van Rossem are published.He does not have to worry about what's going on, 'together with the hair of his head', 'the people are worried about Luther and his reform.She did this in a particularly handy way, 'because by making the comparison with the widely feared desperado', 'Luther came to be seen in a particularly frightening light.He was always still very good in Van Rossem', she puts it in flaming words.The chorus appears to fit within the tradition of the argument, 'a dense one in which a choice is proposed between two things using all possible rhetorical tricks. ']['What has not been discussed in this paper', 'is how (male) rhetoricians responded to Anna\u00e2\\x80\\x99s success.This means that the money will come from the other children', 'since even in her own time it was already judged that she surpassed the men (Pleij', ' 2007', ' p. 370).A different suggestion is different from the work of Bijns ever reaching Luther personally and, if that were the case, 'how he understood this.']"}], "75524207": [{"genre": "Paper", "timestamp": "2012.txt", "text": null}], "25210991": [{"genre": "Essay", "timestamp": "2015-01-06.txt", "text": null}], "07599391": [{"genre": "Essay", "timestamp": "2014-06-01.txt", "text": null}], "99317183": [{"genre": "Essay", "timestamp": "2014-06-01.txt", "text": null}], "51252917": [{"genre": "Essay", "timestamp": "2015-01-06.txt", "text": null}], "53776587": [{"genre": "Essay", "timestamp": "2014-06-01.txt", "text": null}], "77340712": [{"genre": "Essay", "timestamp": "2012.txt", "text": null}], "91064670": [{"genre": "Essay", "timestamp": "2012.txt", "text": null}], "63662409": [{"genre": "Essay", "timestamp": "2013-06-01.txt", "text": null}], "48877017": [{"genre": "Essay", "timestamp": "2012.txt", "text": null}], "65807065": [{"genre": "Essay", "timestamp": "2014-06-01.txt", "text": null}], "38378038": [{"genre": "Essay", "timestamp": "2014-06-01.txt", "text": null}], "62881383": [{"genre": "Essay", "timestamp": "2013-06-01.txt", "text": null}], "51950128": [{"genre": "Essay", "timestamp": "2012.txt", "text": null}], "31883173": [{"genre": "Essay", "timestamp": "2015-01-06.txt", "text": null}], "93580523": [{"genre": "Essay", "timestamp": "2015-01-06.txt", "text": null}], "78624565": [{"genre": "Essay", "timestamp": "2014-06-01.txt", "text": null}], "58289679": [{"genre": "Essay", "timestamp": "2013-06-01.txt", "text": null}, {"genre": "Paper", "timestamp": "2014-06-01.txt", "text": "['\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfINTRODUCTION'] ['Five years ago, Belgium signed an agreement with Morocco and Turkey to facilitate the immigration of workers.In the half century, the number of inhabitants of Moroccan or Turkish origin in Belgium has increased significantly.The population change also has a large number of debates.For North-Afrikaans, young people enjoy a better social status.Their origins all too often link people to juvenile delinquency, bad school results and a broken command of the Dutch language.It is precisely the apparently brekkky language skills that this paper highlights.Is he who wants to have his Moroccan youth in the Netherlands and still have his knees raised?Or is the substandard variant which they speak merely a manner to distinguish themselves based on their origin?']['1.ETNOLECT']Of course, there is no clear boundary that determines when a language variant and an ethnolect are, just as regions are not subdivided according to the exact regional boundaries.There is a continu\u00c3\u00bcm within the taal.There is no price on the beacons.This is also possible in the cafeteria, which is available in different languages \u200b\u200bin the country.The term 'ethnolect' brings various possibilities with me, 'which are discussed at the end of this chapter.First of all, the squads we have been grasped will fit into the situation of Vlaams-Morokkaanse young people in Vlaanderen.']['1.1 DEFINITION OF TERM'] ['In the early 1980s, the American linguists Carlock and W\u00c3\u00b6lck first introduced the concept of ethnolect (1981).They immediately investigated English the European immigrants in Buffalo spoke and knew a different conclusion than linguists before them.Carlock and W\u00c3\u00b6lck established that the type of English spoken by this group of immigrants was not necessarily wrong.Their variation was very different from the standard language, but not in a manner the index earth that they did not master the English language.According to the linguists Carlock and W\u00c3\u00b6lck (1981), the difference in intonation, language use and phonology was rather due to the fact that they wanted to form a separate group, which was clearly separate from the local natives.The differences in language use contributed to the creation of their own identity, 'based on their origins.']['An ethnolect arises from a collection of linguistic characteristics of different origins.For example, second language speakers often adopt words from the original mother tongue and integrate them into the new language.But also the phonology of the second language undergoes adaptation if certain sounds do not occur in the native language.This means that the grammatical foundations can be used as a type for a specific ethnic group (Cornips', '2008). ']['This paper focuses on the variant of Dutch that young people of Moroccan descent speak.Noticeably about this variant is ', ' other', ' the intonation.The Arabic in Berber languages \u200b\u200bfrom Morocco', 'have an intonation which is strongly translated from the Netherlands.People of that origin often retain the lilting way of speaking when they speak Dutch (Jaspers', ' 2008).']['1.2 PROBLEMS SURROUNDING THE TERM \u00e2\\x80\\x98ETNOLECT\u00e2\\x80\\x99'] ['It is important,' as Jasper (2008) states, 'to make a comment on the use of the term \u00e2\\x80\\ x98ethnicity\u00e2\\x80\\x99.The most socio-linguistic backgrounds of this type are used in the context of indicating people to be grouped on the basis of their country of origin.This has real problematic consequences.The state of the knowledgeable social media is based on the needs of individuals and people who can make the difference never met the reality.This reality is also complicit in the two conditions that are used in a different term than \u00e2\\x80\\x98etniciteit\u00e2\\x80\\x99.Turks and Moroccans have a diverse cultural background in the valley.In addition, ', ' according to Jaspers (2008, ') ethnicity is not a factor that is sufficiently stable to determine language choices in itself.We can recognize a dominant variant in the traditional ethnic group, but it is not completely homogeneous.He shows you a systematic school system behind the taalgebruik.The two can analyze and discuss, he wants within the world of sociolinguistics a betekenisful term zijn.The name is the useful for linguists', 'as they are consciously aware of the limitations of the concept.']['2.ETHNOLICS IN USE'] ['The Dutch of a first-generation migrant', ' shows deviations that are due to the adoption of a language at a later age.But the second generation already speaks of Dutch as the language they speak best (Jaspers', ' 2008 ; Mercelis', ' 2012).To identify the majority of speakers in the form of a sample of the ethnic group.We see an example of this in chapter A.This means that the other members of the association can never talk about it. '][] ['2.1 DEFECTIVE SECOND LANGUAGE ACQUISITION VS. IDENTITY FORMATION'] ['People learn language in various ways.The same errors often occur.Volgens van Alphen (1981) is a very good solution for children who are overgeneralized by children.This is the use of substantial amounts of morphological components in interest structures that never fit.Van Alphen states that the child of the 'full meaning' (1981', ' p. 7) of it is not yet understood and therefore not always used correctly.']['Adults who learn a new language also have difficulties with this.Cornips (2008) describes the overgeneralization of the lidwoord \u00e2\\x80\\x98de\u00e2\\x80\\x99.This is therefore a typical form of tweet-aligned speakers from the Netherlands, which has a secondary system that is not always heeled.The lidwoord \u00e2\\x80\\x98de\u00e2\\x80\\x99 comes more voor than \u00e2\\x80\\x98het\u00e2\\x80\\x99', 'this is very logical and it is used.The chance that the article is correct 'is greater.This overgeneralization is not noticeable to the Turks of Moroccan speakers.Cornips (2008) notes that English-speaking immigrants also use articles incorrectly in this manner.He is supposed to be a member of the many people who are associated with Moroccan immigrants.For example, Cornips (2008) observes two Dutch people who stereotype Turkish and Moroccan young people through their language use, 'particularly the overgeneralization of the article.In the fragments from Cornips (2008), for example, the respondents say \u201cthat thing\u201d (p. 116) and \u201cthis tape\u201d (p. 116) or \u201cdie mes\u201d \\x80\\x9d (p. 117) as they imitate young Moroccans or Antilles.']['It is really hasty to conclude from this that younger people are so hindered by their ethnic origin that they cannot do anything other than use articles incorrectly.Cornips (2008) states that the initial decision was made in the first place, so that it was possible to close the association with a bepaalde group for the sake of hearing.The use of the lidwoord is made according to the size of the group.The use of language develops into an ethnolect; never with errors against Standard Dutch', 'but simply with different rules.']['Ethnic background does therefore play a role in the acquisition of language.This includes no additional means of overcoming the immigrants, who are forced to learn the new language.Research has shown that many of these second language speakers can indeed use different variations depending on the situation.The following chapter discusses fieldwork around the Dutch of Moroccans and Turks and their language use in context. ']['2.2 EXTRA-LINGUAL PURPOSES OF LANGUAGE VARIATIONS'] ['Nortier and Dorleijn (2008) note the incense of language variants never consciously assessed.There are various external processes and situations that change in the register of registers. ']['In 2012 Mercelis founded a corpus of the language used by a group of Antwerp girls of diverse origins.This means that the children's girls are vast, and the stereoscopic images are thought about, which are the standard of the Netherlands.The girls that Mercelis studied, 'including some Moroccan', 'used a 'more correct' pronunciation and more appropriate choice of words for comic purposes.You can try it out and laugh at the door to the populaire Belgian nieuwsankers on the day.They made it clear that they were mocking it by speaking exaggerated General Dutch.When asked by Mercelis why that is funny, one of the girls replied that they do not think this statement is adaptable to Moroccan youth because they are simply not that active in school (2012).Further in the interview, 'one of the girls makes it clear that she associates General Dutch with a successful career.For example, her sister has completed her higher studies and she speaks 'General Dutch \u00c3\\xa0 volont\u00c3\u00a9' (Mercelis', ' 2012', ' p.159).']['Mercelis (2012) concludes hereuit that these allochtone girls have the right choice for the role of the various valley variants in the Belgian seed leving and are also available for use.She doesn't know all what he plays in the world of French cultural phenomena in the form of a television program in the 80s', 'but she also masters the appropriate registers and knows how to use them in past contexts.']['Jaspers (2005) also found from field work that Moroccan boys adapt variegated language varieties to their will for perlocutionary reasons.For example, he noticed that they use General Dutch to 'act ridiculous'.Furthermore,' says Jaspers, 'the ease with which they alternate between linguistic variants shows that they do indeed possess the linguistic competencies that many doubt.The right to apply the Dutch Algemeen to the real situation in which the impediment to the image of the young people can be made for the sake of their own (Jaspers', '2008).']['According to Jaspers (2008), Flemish-Moroccan young also turn to the dialect of a certain region', ' to obtain a comic effect.Jaspers also experienced that the Flemish-Moroccan young people he interviewed, 'their own language variant a higher level of language to be spoken in the Antwerp dialect spoken in the Flemish classmates.The dialect is far removed from Standard Dutch and so they qualify it as \u201cbad Dutch\u201d (Jaspers', ' 2008', ' 95).']['As the examples above indicate and as also became clear in the work of Nortier (2008)', 'the study of ethnolects is especially interesting for young people.The name of the two generations of immigrants in the Netherlands in the Netherlands is at school, and now there is more to come.Although the circumstances are relevant to study, they paradoxically also constitute an obstacle.He is fit for the adolescents who are on the other side of the world, he brings what social implications with me.Young people are 'more subject to social pressure than adults'.The sound that you get from listening to it is much more intense.This is the summer of the sun, which allows you to make the necessary competence in gewoon \u00e2\\x80\\x98stoer doen\u00e2\\x80\\x99.'][] [] ['3.Conclusion']Many sociolinguists come to the conclusion of the drawn-out ethnolects rather and representation of the pursuit of group formation on the basis of origin through an exclusiveness in language use.The association of taalgebruik with afkomst is the most suitable for younger immigrants.They grow up with the language they use in their manner.The paradox lies in the fact that the young people have the opportunity to study the subject, 'since the distinction is vague between where they are linguistically competent and where they consciously deviate from Standard Dutch in function of their image.']['A so far less exposed aspect of this topic is the adoption of ethnolect elements by young people who do not have a Moroccan or Turkish background.Indigenous young people are increasingly using Arabic particles or exclamations such as tfoe or ze\u00d8\u00b9ma (Nortier & Dorleijn', ' 2008).Whether it arises from the same theory that states that language serves to accomplish a desired identity, 'and that consequently the Flemish-Moroccan identity is the desired one', needs to be determined by further research.
